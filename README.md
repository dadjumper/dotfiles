# dotfiles

These are all of my main dotfiles for my Arch install with i3+polybar. All the colors are set via wal. I've also included my firefox css and my startpage for funzies. 
All of these dotfiles are cobbled together from defaults or other people's found online, so they're a complete mess. But, they're functional, so I don't mind. If you want to learn from them, sorry
